#Post_it-Part2
=============

##What is this app about?
An improved version of my Postit Part 1 Javascript app.
It was built for users who want to have a dynamic post_it in their computer 

##Why did I code this app?
*I created this app to learn and practice Javascript while building a product that I can use in my daily activities ( I am a to-do list girl).  
*I improved this app which results can be found in the post_it Part 2 repo
